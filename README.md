### PROBLEM STATEMENT
How to predict the probability of a given twitter account to be a bot (bot: no direct human involvement in generating tweets)
(alternative: predicting the probability of a given tweet to be a bot tweet)
  1. Solve as a classification problem of classifying an account to be bot or not-bot
  2. Solve as an unsupervised problem of clustering twitter accounts into 2 (or several) clusters
